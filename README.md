## Python scripts written to run on a Linux server inside a venv or Docker container.
### cnb_dev.py is a tree-based approach to text classification that is implemented using a scikit-learn complement naive bayes classifier at each node.
### predict_hs.py provides a user-friendly interface for the application of an exported model from cnb_dev.py to live data through a SQL query.
